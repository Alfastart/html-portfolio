<h1> THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ROHAN </h1>
<h1>First of all, it is literally impossible for me to pick a favourite movie or song.<br /> I mean 100 plus years of
    amazing and mind blowing cinema and i cannot just pick one.</h1>

<hr />

<h2> SOME OF THE MOVIES THAT I LIKE ARE:-</h2>

<h2>2 states</h2>
<p>I like everything about this movie. The story, the characters, the songs especially "Mast Magan".<br /> I mean when
    you
    think about the movie or hear or read the name of this movie. The first thing that comes to the mind is that song
    "mast magan".
</p>

<h2>THE DEADPOOL FRANCHISE</h2>
<p>This is one of my favourite Superheroes Franchise. The best thing about this movie is its Hindi dubbing,<br /> they nailed
    it in every part. Deadpool has action, comedy, drama, Ryan Reynolds(this is enough to hook you to this movie).<br /> And
    after the disaster that struck the whole MCU after the endgame, Deadpool is one of the few remaining gems in the
    MCU. </p>
